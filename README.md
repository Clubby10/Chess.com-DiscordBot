# Chess.com-DiscordBot
A Discord bot that uses the Chess.com API to retrieve data for a player and displays it in a Discord channel. The bot listens for a message that starts with `!chess` and retrieves data for the player specified in the command (e.g. `!chess username`). The bot is built using the `discord.js` library and the `axios` library to make API requests.
